# PETSIRD basic Python example

As you can now install the `petsird` package from PyPI, you likely no longer
need this repository and can just use `pip install petsird`.
You can of course use the Python package generated from the local PETSIRD
clone (`cd python; pip install .`). See
https://github.com/ETSInitiative/PETSIRD/tree/main/python#readme
for more information.
